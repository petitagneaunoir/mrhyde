  <p>Here I am at the Getty Museum. I love this photograph for two reasons. 1) I am arriving right before the "magic hour," when dusk will fall and luminous shadows will play across the Getty's golden limestone walls 2) although taken at a time when I had no job prospects (or real bed for that matter), each day was a joy because I got to spend it making crazy art pieces and designing new projects.<br /><br />This photo is a reminder of those hard and scrappy times that led me into the digital field but also never to forget that feeling of trying something new.</p>
